        "question": "Are my investments insured?",

This means your assets are protected by SIPC insurance, covering up to $500,000, including $250,000 for cash claims. While this protects against broker-dealer failure, it’s important to note that it doesn’t insure against market losses—investing inherently carries risk, and Paasa’s role is to help you manage that risk intelligently."
    },
    {
        "question": "Do you actively manage the portfolio?",
        "answer": "No, Paasa focuses on optimized index investing - a semi-passive strategy. Here’s why: in the U.S., only about 5% of actively managed funds consistently beat the index over time. This is due to market efficiency, where all available information is quickly reflected in stock prices, making it incredibly hard for active managers to outperform consistently. We focus on low-cost index funds, automated rebalancing, and tax optimization. This way, we can deliver reliable growth without the high fees and unpredictability of active management."

        "question": "What is Paasa's pricing?",

We’re also fortunate to be backed by some of the most respected angels and VCs in finance, who deeply understand and resonate with our product principles.
