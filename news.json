ROKU.\n\n&gt; The analyst commented: \"Yesterday, Walmart closed its $2.3B acquisition of Vizio, which was announced in Feb 2024. Walmart's urgent need was driven by AMZN's decision to make all 200mm of its Prime Video subscribers ad- driven in Jan 2024. AMZN then linked its CTV ads to actual purchases made on its site, thereby creating the first RMN (retail media network) with \"closed-loop attribution\". Walmart will now \"fast follow\" AMZN and create a better RMN by tying Vizio's CTV ads to Walmart's online and offline sales.\n\n&gt; We expect Roku to be purchased for a large premium within the next 12 months. We believe that there are several categories of potential purchasers including streamers (NFLX, etc), CTV ad buyers (TTD, etc), retailers (Target, etc), and LLMs (large language models) hungry for billions of new data points daily (AMZN/AWS, MSFT/OpenAI, GOOGL/YouTube/Gemini, etc). The top 6 reasons to acquire Roku (our view) include its installed base, unique data sets, pricing power, shelf space, buy vs build advantages, and the fact that it's now the only scaled CTV platform that can be purchased"

That is enough to power more than one million homes. Neal Kirby, an Entergy spokesman, said the plants will also provide power to the surrounding community.\n\n\u201cEntergy raised its earnings growth outlook substantially (solely because of this 1 new customer) and the stock rose 15% on that day,\u201d wrote Rodney Rebello, an analyst covering power stocks at Reaves Asset Management, in an email to\u00a0*Barron\u2019s*.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a monumental deal for the sector.\u201d\n\nMeta spokeswoman Stacey Yip told\u00a0*Barron\u2019s*\u00a0the Louisiana data center \u201cwill be significantly larger than our other data center campuses.\u201d\n\nThe company didn\u2019t say how many GPUs the new facility will be able to support.

All told, Meta will help finance \u201cenough clean and renewable energy to the grid to match the total electricity use of this data center,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t clear when those renewable projects will start. Entergy has filed for permission with the state utilities commission to build the natural gas plants, but not the renewable ones yet, Kirby said.\n\nMeta also said on Tuesday that it is exploring using nuclear energy to power data centers, and asked companies in that field to submit proposals for nuclear reactors. Any reactors wouldn\u2019t be available until well into the 2030s, however.\n\nMeta is investing\u00a0heavily in artificial intelligence\u00a0and has been expanding the number of data centers it uses to process its AI applications.

        "Content": "American Eagle\u00a0issued weak holiday guidance on Wednesday and cut its full-year forecast as it contends with value-seeking consumers who are only willing to spend during key shopping moments.\u00a0\n\nThe apparel retailer narrowly missed Wall Street\u2019s expectations on the top line, but beat on the bottom line.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s how American Eagle performed during its third fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\n* **Earnings per share:**\u00a048 cents adjusted\u00a0vs. 46 cents expected\n* **Revenue:**\u00a0$1.29 billion\u00a0vs. $1.30 billion expected\n\nThe company\u2019s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $80 million, or 41 cents per share, compared with $96.7 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges related to restructuring and impairment costs, American Eagle posted an adjusted profit of 48 cents per share.\u00a0\n\nSales dropped to $1.29 billion, down about 1% from $1.3 billion a year earlier.\u00a0\n\nWhile it was narrow, Wednesday\u2019s miss is the third quarter in a row that American Eagle has not met Wall Street\u2019s sales targets.\n\nShares dropped about 13% in extended trading.\n\nIn a statement, CEO Jay Schottenstein touted a \u201cstrong\u201d back-to-school shopping season but said demand remains inconsistent in between major shopping events.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe have entered the holiday season well positioned, with our leading brands offering high-quality merchandise, great gifts and an outstanding shopping experience across channels,\u201d Schottenstein said. \u201cKey selling periods have seen a positive customer response, yet we remain cognizant of potential choppiness during non-peak periods.\u201d\u00a0\n\nConsumers coming out for key shopping moments, and then sharply dropping off, has been a consistent theme across the retail industry.\u00a0Foot Locker\u00a0cited a\u00a0similar dynamic\u00a0when reporting earnings earlier on Wednesday, as did\u00a0Dollar Tree.\n\nFor its holiday quarter, American Eagle is expecting comparable sales to be up around 1% with total sales down about 4%, including an $85 million impact from having\u00a0one less selling week\u00a0and a later start to the holiday shopping season. The outlook is below the 2.2% comparable sales growth StreetAccount was looking for and the 1% sales decline LSEG had expected.\u00a0\n\nAs a result, American Eagle is now expecting comparable sales to grow by 3% for the full year, down from prior guidance of 4% growth and below StreetAccount\u2019s estimate of 4.1%. It\u2019s now expecting full-year sales to be up 1%, down from previous guidance of between 2% and 3% and below LSEG expectations of 2.5% growth.\u00a0\n\nSimilar to other retailers, American Eagle had taken a cautious approach to the back half of the year as it contended with\u00a0uncertainty around the 2024 election\u00a0and the overall macroeconomic environment. But unlike its competitors, it has kept that cautious tone.\n\nBoth\u00a0Abercrombie &amp; Fitch\u00a0and\u00a0Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, which\u00a0issued cautious outlooks\u00a0earlier this year,\u00a0reversed their previous mood\u00a0when\u00a0reporting earnings\u00a0earlier this month.\u00a0\n\nDespite the underwhelming outlook and sales miss, American Eagle is seeing strong demand for its Aerie brand. Third-quarter revenue for Aerie came in at an all-time high for the company and comparable sales grew 5%, on top of 12% growth from the year-ago period.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/american-eagle-aeo-earnings-q3-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/american-eagle-aeo-earnings-q3-2024.html)"

        "Content": "Intel (INTC) is in crisis. The company forced out CEO Pat Gelsinger on Monday, its stock price is down more than 50% on the year, and the grand plan to add third-party semiconductor manufacturing to its repertoire is suddenly more unclear than ever.\n\nGelsinger\u2019s gambit to transform Intel into a US-based version of Taiwan\u2019s TSMC that builds chips for its rivals is one of the reasons the company received $7.8 billion in CHIPS Act funding. But the foundry business, which it plans to operate as an independent subsidiary, has been hemorrhaging money and its biggest customer is still Intel itself.\n\nYes, the company has picked up deals to build chips for Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), but that hasn\u2019t quelled calls for Intel to kill its third-party foundry plan. Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya wrote in an investor note that Intel could go as far as fully separating its design and manufacturing businesses.\n\nBut ditching its fabs, or fabrication facilities, is a lot easier said than done, especially if Intel wants to hold on to those CHIPS Act funds.\n\n\u201cThey just got the CHIPS Acts money. And if you look very closely at the details, it basically says that Intel cannot sell more than a controlling share of the manufacturing footprint,\u201d explained Mario Morales, group vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at IDC. \u201cSo that means that Intel will have to maintain manufacturing control of their capacity.\u201d\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s no easy path forward for the US\u2019s largest homegrown chip builder.\n\nThe Commerce Department and Intel announced the chipmaker would be getting CHIPS Act funding just last week, with the DoC saying the cash would help Intel expand its manufacturing capacity in the US, a key part of Gelsinger\u2019s plan to help the company compete with TSMC and Samsung, two of the largest chipmakers in the world.\n\nGelsinger initially unveiled the ambitious agenda, called IDM 2.0, or integrated device manufacturing 2.0, in 2021, the same year he took the reins as CEO. At the time, he said Intel would create a world-class foundry business. But Gelsinger took over an Intel beset by problems.\n\nLack of investment and missed opportunities over the years meant the company failed to catch the mobile wave and fell behind TSMC in design capabilities. And building out a global manufacturing footprint isn\u2019t cheap, which, for a company that was already hurting, wasn\u2019t ideal.\n\nGelsinger had four years to make the turnaround happen, and while Intel\u2019s chip design process is catching up, building chip manufacturing facilities takes time, more than Intel\u2019s board seemed interested in giving Gelsinger.\n\n\u201cSome of the problems that Intel had, and still has, are not things you can solve overnight. They are multiyear issues,\u201d said TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O\u2019Donnell.\n\n\u201cGelsinger started on a path to follow some of these things. And I think ultimately, at the highest level, what he chose to do, which is to get the manufacturing stuff back in shape and to work on design, is ultimately what the company needs to do.\u201d\n\nNow Intel has to make a decision: carry on with Gelsinger\u2019s plan or cut back and focus on its own chip building capabilities or give up the business entirely. But doing that means saying goodbye to CHIPS Act money unless it can get approval from the Commerce Department\n\nUnder the terms of the CHIPS Act agreement, Intel is prohibited from certain change of control transactions. If the company spins off its foundry business, it has to hold on to at least 50.1% of the voting rights of the entity if it\u2019s a private company. If the new entity goes public, a third party can\u2019t own 35% or more of it. That means Intel can\u2019t simply cut its foundry business loose and go fabless if it wants to hold on to that CHIPS money.\n\nBut moving forward with the foundry model could be difficult.\n\n\u201cI think as a combined entity it's hard to survive, because the biggest problem is your potential customers for foundry are all your competitors against Intel products,\u201d explained Gartner analyst Gaurav Gupta. \u201cSo how would they have trust in Intel foundry and become its customers, right?\u201d\n\nIf Intel does end up pulling back on its third-party manufacturing ambitions, however, it could end up eating a good portion of the losses.\n\n\u201cYou'd have to scale back. You'd have to lay off people. I'm sure there would be some sunk cost, but the alternative is you keep losing billions of dollars a quarter,\u201d Citi head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely told Yahoo Finance. \u201cSo, I think you just need to scrap it. Take your lumps. If you have to, return the money to the government.\u201d\n\nWhile Danely believes Intel should drop its goal of serving as a global foundry for other companies, he says it should continue to build its own chips.\n\n\u201cI still think they should manufacture their own CPUs,\u201d he explained. \"There's been speculation for a long time that they're just going to turn the keys over to [TSMC] and have [TSMC] make everything. We don't think that that's the right move.\u201d\n\nBefore that, however, Intel needs to find a new permanent CEO.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/intels-ceo-shakeup-puts-foundry-plans-chips-act-cash-at-risk-194227625.html"

Is Costco doing something different with their business model in 2024 that justifies the PE to almost double from the start of 2024?

There is also the argument that the government cannot afford a recession at the moment and will not allow one to occur, we are in too much debt and cannot afford these high interest payments meaning that the government will chat interest rates again and spend as much as it needs to to avoid a recession causing hyperinflation and a \u201cgreat melt up\u201d in all assets, instead of an everything bubble it will be come an everything mega bubble which will last until the end of the decade.

        "Content": "Washington, D.C.\u2019s attorney general sued\u00a0Amazon\u00a0on Wednesday, accusing the company of covertly depriving residents in certain ZIP codes in the nation\u2019s capital from access to Prime\u2019s high-speed delivery.\n\nThe lawsuit from AG Brian Schwalb alleges that, since 2022, Amazon has \u201csecretly excluded\u201d two \u201chistorically underserved\u201d D.C. ZIP codes from its expedited delivery service while charging Prime members living there the full subscription price. Amazon\u2019s Prime membership program costs $139 a year and includes perks like two-day shipping and access to streaming content.\n\n\u201cAmazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide,\u201d Schwalb said in a statement. \u201cWhile Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one zip code is worth less than a dollar in another.\u201d\n\nIn June 2022, Amazon allegedly stopped using its own delivery trucks to shuttle packages in the ZIP codes 20019 and 20020 based on concerns over driver safety, the suit states. In place of its in-house delivery network, the company relied on outside carriers like\u00a0UPS\u00a0and the U.S. Postal Service to make deliveries, according to the complaint, which was filed in D.C. Superior Court.\n\nThe decision caused residents in those ZIP codes to experience \u201csignificantly longer delivery times than their neighbors in other District ZIP codes, despite paying the exact same membership price for Prime,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nData from the AG shows that before Amazon instituted the change, more than 72% of Prime packages in the two ZIP codes were delivered within two days of checkout. That number dropped to as low as 24% following the move, while two-day delivery rates across the district increased to 74%.\n\nAmazon has faced prior complaints of disparities in its Prime program. In 2016, the company\u00a0said it would expand\u00a0access to same-day delivery in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Washington, after\u00a0a Bloomberg investigation\u00a0found Black residents were \u201cabout half as likely\u201d to be eligible for same-day delivery as white residents.\n\nThe ZIP codes in Schwalb\u2019s complaint are in areas with large Black populations, according to 2022 Census data based on its American Community Survey.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission\u00a0also sued Amazon in June 2023, accusing the company of tricking consumers into signing up for Prime and \u201csabotaging\u201d their attempts to cancel by employing so-called dark patterns, or deceptive design tactics meant to steer users toward a specific choice. Amazon said the complaint was \u201cfalse on the facts and the law.\u201d The case is set to go to trial in June 2025.\n\nAccording to Scwalb\u2019s complaint, Amazon never communicated the delivery exclusion to Prime members in the area. When consumers in the affected ZIP codes complained to Amazon about slower delivery speeds, the company said it was due to circumstances outside its control, the suit says.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Amazon of violating the district\u2019s consumer protection laws. It also asks the court to \u201cput an end to Amazon\u2019s deceptive conduct,\u201d as well as for damages and penalties.\n\nTo get packages to customers\u2019 doorsteps, Amazon uses a combination of its own contracted delivery companies, usually distinguishable by Amazon-branded cargo vans, as well as carriers like USPS, UPS and\u00a0FedEx, and a network of gig workers who make deliveries from their own vehicles as part of its Flex program.\n\nAmazon has rapidly expanded its in-house logistics army in recent years as it looks to speed up deliveries from two days to one day or even a few hours. In July, the company\u00a0said\u00a0it recorded its \u201cfastest Prime delivery speeds ever\u201d in the first half of the year, delivering more than 5 billion items within a day.\n\nIn relying on its own workforce, Amazon has assumed greater control over its delivery operations.\n\nIn his complaint, Schwalb cites an internal company policy that says Amazon may choose to exclude certain areas from being served by its in-house delivery network if a driver experiences \u201cviolence, intimidation or harassment.\u201d The company relies on UPS or USPS to deliver packages in excluded areas.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/amazon-sued-by-dc-ag-over-excluding-areas-from-prime-delivery.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/amazon-sued-by-dc-ag-over-excluding-areas-from-prime-delivery.html)"

It also anticipates another $2.7 billion in charges to restructure the business, including \u201cplant closures and portfolio optimization,\u201d according to the filing.\n\nGM, which previously announced plans to\u00a0restructure the operations\u00a0in China, did not disclose any additional details about the expected closures.\n\n\u201cAs we have consistently said, we are focused on capital efficiency and cost discipline and have been working with SGM to turn around the business in China in order to be sustainable and profitable in the market.\u00a0We are close to finalizing our restructuring plan with our partner, and we expect our results in China in 2025 to show year-over-year improvement,\u201d GM said in an emailed statement.\n\nGM said it believes the joint venture \u201chas the ability to restructure without new cash investments\u201d from the American automaker.\n\nA majority of the restructuring costs is expected to be recognized as non-cash, special item charges during the fourth quarter. That means they will impact the automaker\u2019s net income, but not its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes \u2013 a key metric monitored by Wall Street.\n\nGM\u2019s operations in China have shifted\u00a0from a profit engine to liability\u00a0in the past decade as competition grows from government-backed domestic automakers fueled by nationalism, and as a\u00a0generational shift in consumer perceptions\u00a0of the automotive industry and electric vehicles takes hold.\n\nEquity income from GM\u2019s Chinese operations and joint ventures peaked at more than $2 billion in 2014 and 2015.\n\nGM\u2019s market share in China, including its joint ventures, has plummeted from roughly 15% as recently as 2015 to 8.6% last year \u2014 the first time it has dropped below 9% since 2003. GM\u2019s equity income from the operations have also fallen, down 78.5% since peaking in 2014, according to regulatory filings.\n\nGM\u2019s U.S.-based brands such as Buick and Chevrolet have seen sales drop more than its joint venture sales with SAIC Motor, Wuling Motors and others. The joint venture models accounted for about 60% of its 2.1 million vehicles sold last year in China.\n\nPrior to this year, the only quarterly losses for GM in China since 2009 were a $167 million shortfall during the first quarter of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic and an $87 million loss during the second quarter of 2022.\n\nThe Detroit automaker has reported\u00a0three consecutive quarterly losses\u00a0in equity income for its Chinese operations this year, totaling $347 million. That includes a loss of $137 million during the third quarter.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/gms-expects-more-than-5-billion-impact-from-china-restructuring-including-plant-closures.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/gms-expects-more-than-5-billion-impact-from-china-restructuring-including-plant-closures.html)"

        "Content": "Live in Bay Area and we bought a house in 2020 (locked in a 3%). Thankfully our mortgage was affordable for us but last year's promotion meant going to fixed salary and no longer receiving company's overtime pay. Promotion meant my \"salary\" went up $20k but no longer getting OT meant actually taking a $50k cut. (120k went to 140k but actual take home was 190k now down to 140k).  \nSalaried positions get RSUs which help offset pay loss and, in a few years, my pay increases should start to bring me back up to last year's take-home. Basically we're now in the \"house-poor\" group. We're thankful for our situation but understandably this requires a lot of budgeting.\n\nWith that background here's our situation:  \nWe really want to remodel our house. For what we want to do I'm estimating $150k budget (kitchen, bathrooms, interior, exterior, adding doors, moving windows, floors, etc...). Our neighbor recently did a similar remodel for $75k but I think he had a connection with a few contractors. I don't have final quotes yet and our budget will help us determine what is a priority. \n\nI could pay for all of this if I sold some company stock but, this stock traditionally does really well and last 5years saw a 200+% return.  So if I sell this stock then I'm missing out on future potential returns, essentially making this remodel perpetually more expensive. \n\nAlternative is something like a Margin Loan or a HELOC. I'd be able to fulfill our reno budget with a margin loan and keep our LTV pretty low.   \nThe problem with taking a loan (like HELOC) is that we would need to sell stock to make the payments. If we're using the stock as leverage for a loan then selling stock to pay the loan, is that any better than just selling stock to buy what we need? The only benefit I could see is feathering the stock sales over time to leverage as much gains as possible, compared to selling it all now.\n\nHaving contractors coming in soon to start quotes and give timelines. I'll need to have a finance plan in place soon.   \nThanks.\n\nTLDR: house poor but need renovations. Asking if we pay for work with stock sale or take out loan and slowly pay loan via selling stocks? "

        "Content": "Canaan (CAN): The Bitcoin Gold Rush Pickaxe Play \ud83d\udc8e\u26cf\ufe0f\n\nIn the 19th-century gold rush, the real winners were the ones selling tools\u2014picks, shovels, and axes. Today, in the digital gold rush of Bitcoin, Canaan Inc. (CAN) plays a similar role, providing the essential hardware that powers cryptocurrency mining operations worldwide.\n\nThe Hashrate Arms Race\n\nPublicly traded Bitcoin mining companies are scaling up their operations to increase hashrate\u2014the computational power used to mine Bitcoin and process transactions. This race is driven by the need to secure more mining rewards and maintain profitability as mining difficulty rises.\n\nCanaan is uniquely positioned to profit from this expansion as mining companies continue to demand high-performance hardware for their growing operations.\n\nRecent Industry Expansions and Acquisitions\n\n\t\u2022\tMarathon Digital Holdings: Acquired two operational Bitcoin mining sites in December 2023, totaling 390 megawatts of capacity, for $178.6 million.\n\t\u2022\tCleanSpark Inc.: In October 2024, acquired GRIID Infrastructure Inc., significantly expanding its mining capacity in Tennessee.\n\t\u2022\tRiot Platforms: Acquired Block Mining in July 2024, boosting its total power capacity to 2 gigawatts.\n\nThese expansions highlight the growing demand for efficient and cost-effective mining hardware\u2014a market Canaan serves directly.\n\nCanaan\u2019s Strategic Position\n\nCanaan\u2019s AvalonMiner series is designed to meet the needs of both large-scale and smaller mining operations. Here\u2019s how it compares to key competitors:\n\n\t\u2022\tAvalonMiner A1246: 90 TH/s hash rate with 38 J/TH efficiency.\n\n\t\u2022\tBitmain Antminer S19 Pro: 110 TH/s with 30 J/TH efficiency.\n\n\t\u2022\tMicroBT Whatsminer M30S++: 112 TH/s with 31 J/TH efficiency.\n\nWhile competitors lead in raw performance, Canaan\u2019s hardware offers strong value through competitive pricing and accessibility. This balance positions Canaan as a key player in the mining hardware supply chain, particularly for cost-conscious operations.\n\nRecent Bullish Developments\n\nCanaan has also secured large purchase agreements from major mining companies:\n\n\t\u2022\tHIVE Digital Technologies: Ordered 5,000 Avalon A15-194T miners (194 TH/s each) after a previous order for 6,500 Avalon A1566 miners.\n\n\t\u2022\tCipher Mining Technologies: Purchased 6,600 Avalon A1566 miners earlier in 2024.\n\n\t\u2022\tThe recent order of 3,800 Avalon A1566I Immersion Cooling Miners from CleanSpark underscores the growing demand for Canaan's cutting-edge technology. This large-scale adoption by industry players signals a vote of confidence in Canaan's ability to meet the evolving needs of the mining sector\n\nThese deals highlight the demand for Canaan\u2019s hardware and its ability to cater to large-scale operations.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the escalating competition among Bitcoin miners, Canaan profits as the supplier of essential hardware. As mining companies expand through acquisitions and infrastructure development, Canaan\u2019s position as a key provider makes it well-suited to capitalize on the industry\u2019s growth.\n\nTL;DR: Canaan isn\u2019t mining Bitcoin\u2014they\u2019re selling the tools miners need. As the mining industry grows, so do Canaan\u2019s opportunities. Miners compete, Canaan profits. NFA."

Spent years building this account. I tossed everything in there.\n\n###DD\n\nAm pure-blooded Chinese. Grew up in canada. Moved back to China last year.\n\nMany of you ass clowns subscribe to the concept that Chinese have small dicks. Honestly that\u2019s cool, but if you subscribe to that, then you must also subscribe to the fact that chinese have high IQs\n\nPDD has about 14k employees. It is amongst the elite of the elite companies to work at, especially for fresh chinese college grads. China has 1.4 billion people.\n\nImagine a high IQ country of 1.4 billion people, now imagine 14k of the highest IQ people out of those 1.4 billion high IQ people working at a single company, and you got PDD.\n\n###China\u2019s 996 work culture\n\n996 means 9am - 9pm, 6 days a week. Basically a 70-hour work week. It\u2019s extremely toxic, but undoubtedly the most competitive work model in the world.\n\nImagine a company of people with average IQ of 135, all working 70 hours a week. Imagine the competitiveness of such an organization.\n\nTemu\u2019s tremendous growth is no surprise. Temu is the fastest growth e-commerce marketplace for a good fucking reason. Like I mentioned, it\u2019s built by an organization with an average IQ of 135, with basically everyone no life working 70 hour weeks.\n\n###Personal experience:\n\n- So far in China I dated 2 girls working from PDD. One worked in HR and one worked in product. They were horribly unattractive. Why? They dunno how to use makeup, they dunno how to dress. They only know how to work. The HR girl especially, told me just how many interviews they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re growing FAST. Their work pace is literally incomprehensible for clueless westerners. I\u2019d wager most US tech workers would probably have a mental breakdown if they work 1 month at PDD, because they simply can\u2019t handle its pace and the stress.\n- After moving back to china, I first started buying shit off jd.com and taobao because I haven\u2019t heard of PDD. Then one day I started using PDD, and from that day onwards, 80% of my online purchases are from PDD. It\u2019s simply the best shopping app in China for most items. That\u2019s all you need to know.\n\nThe biggest counter-argument is\u2026 \u201cBut it\u2019s a chinese company! They\u2019re cooking the books\u201d\n\n- Just because 1 chinese company cooked the books, doesn\u2019t mean every chinese company is cooking the books, dumbass.\n- Chinese companies live in fear of being delisted due to the bad reputation that chinese companies have. Do you really think they\u2019re dumb enough to cook the books when they got a target on their back? If you got a target pointed at your back, you play it safe, dumbass.\n- That 1 chinese company known for cooking its books? Well, if you bought its stock at the bottom, you would have 15x\u2019ed your money, dumbass\n\nPDD is a long term hold for me, although I might consider selling if it hits ~$200 USD (2x my book value) in a short timeframe and look at other options.\n\n###This is a sure thing.\n\n###Trust me on this one.\n\nP.S. Most of you dumbasses are too dumb to realize that China\u2019s stock market today is like US\u2019s stock market in the 70s. Buffett\u2019s success cannot be replicated today in the US market, but it can be replicated in the chinese market. There are so many undervalued stocks in the Chinese stock market today due to the intense fear investors have for the Chinese stock market, both from domestic chinese investors and international. There are so many opportunities in the chinese stock market today, but most of you watch too much western propaganda and don\u2019t have enough brain cells to think anything else except \u201cCHINA BAD\u201d, \u201cCANT TRUST NO CHINESE COMPANY\u201d, \u201cTHEY BE COOKING THE BOOKS AND SHIT YO\u201d, \u201cCHINESE BE COMMUNIST AND SHIT BRO LOL\u201d"

I can think a billion better ways to spend that money. That short was meant to make a statement, as it is nearly negligible to Bill\u2019s Net Worth.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to say that Bill shorted Tesla because it is trading at a price to earnings ratio of 96 during a good economy. And perhaps Bill knows exactly what happens to automakers when the economy suffers, hint\u2026 some go bankrupt - RIP Pontiac.\n\nOr, Bill has realized what many are starting to see. What I see at least.\n\nElon\u2019s pay is tied to metrics of Tesla\u2019s stock capitalization. So, the more the stock rises, the richer Elon becomes.\u00a0\n\nNow any idiot with half a desire to make another dollar would do whatever necessary to make the price go up, what the wannabe wolfs on wall street call \u201ca pump\u201d\n\nElon\u2019s package, which is hard to write with a straight face, is the dump.\n\nSo how exactly do we conclude this is a pump and dump, and not a massively successful and brilliant person working around the clock to ensure the success of every venture?\n\nFor starters, if we include: Tesla, TwitterX, xAI, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Nueralink, and now the Department of Government Efficiency\n\nthat\u2019s seven major organizations that he\u2019s allegedly devoting time to. If you don\u2019t factor traveling or sleeping, or basically any function besides working, it averages out at best for each company he is spending 1 day per week.\u00a0\n\nIn all reality, some are getting more attention than others, and he most likely delegates any real work to anybody but himself. So yeah, maybe it\u2019s possible.\n\nOr perhaps the success of the other companies is so much less serious because simply put, they were just meant to drive up the price of Tesla.\n\nRemember when Tesla bought bitcoin? They bought in January 2021 for a price of $33,000 and sold in July of 2022 for a price of $23,000.\u00a0 And since then, Tesla has rallied whenever Bitcoin rallies, even though Tesla sold for a 30% loss. Or remember the dogg coin pump and dump Elon did via tweets?\n\nBy starting all these other companies and ventures, Elon has made people believe in the idea of him. That anything he does is successful. Except, his success, on the backs of other actually brilliant people mind you, is about 3 for 6 with his current engagements. (#7- Department of Government Efficiency can\u2019t be counted yet because it hasn\u2019t happened yet)\n\nTesla - Successful, albeit fraught with troubles from Model 3 production, FSD that\u2019s always a year away, and the Cybertruck which was such a bad vehicle, from concept to build, that it has it\u2019s own subreddit dedicated to mocking it.\n\nTwitter/X - Was successful under it\u2019s deadname, of Twitter, but now it\u2019s become a well known propaganda machine.\n\nxAI - It\u2019s so unsuccessful so far I had to ask Gemini about it, and it told me it\u2019s name is Grok.\n\nSpaceX - Pretty successful venture as far as the goal, maybe not so much the revenue portion, again though, it\u2019s built by other geniuses. Actual \u2018Rocket Scientists\u2019\n\nHowever, now it\u2019s becoming it\u2019s own traded company in the form of a Tender Offer, so in theory it shouldn\u2019t have as much association with Tesla.\u00a0\n\nThe Boring Company - Lol @ Las Vegas. Definitely not a success.\n\nNueralink - Kills monkeys and wants to accomplish the same goal as Twitter/X, which is control peoples thoughts.\n\nIn short, all of these side projects were meant to get people talking about Elon, and Tesla in order to drive up the price. It worked. He became the richest man in the world 3 years ago (2021). When Tesla dropped in 2022, I thought people had finally realized that it wasn\u2019t all it was cracked up to be. But here we are, on the precipice of a wild year that many are already saying will have a major market correction."

        "Content": "TL;DR: \nRobinhood\u2019s Investor Day highlighted massive growth opportunities, including expanding crypto offerings (20 to 260 tokens), entering institutional trading, and exploring sports betting with innovative products like event contracts. The company\u2019s profitability, $600B TAM, and focus on global expansion position it as a long-term fintech powerhouse. I\u2019m bullish AF on $HOOD, with a $55 call expiring in 2027 and plans to buy shares monthly.\n______________________________________\nPost:\n\nGood Evening my fellow WSB Regards!\n\nI\u2019ve attached the link to the post so you can check out Robinhood\u2019s Investor Presentation or watch the livestream from earlier today yourself. Trust me, it\u2019s worth a look if you want to dig into the details.\n\nI apologize in advance if this post looks like a bag of ass. I\u2019m posting from my phone, and Reddit is making it harder to edit this than it should be. But trust me\u2014if it\u2019s readable enough, you\u2019re gonna want to stick around and read through this because there\u2019s some serious juice here.\n\nAfter watching parts of the livestream, reading through their Investor Presentation, and sprinkling in some speculation, here\u2019s why I think you should be bullish on $HOOD for the short-term, near-term, long-term, and forever:\n\n_____________________________________\n1. Short-Term Growth Drivers\n\n\u2022Staking Expansion: Robinhood\u2019s staking rollout in Europe has already onboarded $4M+ in assets, with 24% of Solana staked on the platform. A broader U.S. rollout is on the horizon and could significantly boost revenues and user engagement.\n\t\n\u2022Crypto Expansion: Robinhood currently supports 20 crypto tokens but has plans to scale to match Coinbase\u2019s 260 assets. This expansion will attract more active traders and drive Robinhood\u2019s share of the growing crypto market.\n\n\u2022Profitable Growth: Robinhood hit $2.4B in LTM net revenue (up 36% YoY) and $949M in adjusted EBITDA (up 96% YoY). They\u2019re no longer just a disruptor\u2014they\u2019re now a profitable fintech powerhouse.\n\n___________________________________\n2. Near-Term Strategic Initiatives\n\n\u2022Institutional Crypto Market: Institutional trading makes up 80% of crypto volume, and Robinhood is moving into this space through partnerships and acquisitions. By offering low-cost trading, they\u2019re positioned to capture a huge chunk of this untapped revenue.\n\n\u2022Robinhood Legend: Their new desktop platform, Robinhood Legend, is targeting the 50% of retail trading volume conducted on web-based platforms. This move aims to win over users who currently trade with incumbents.\n\t\n\u2022Global Expansion: With plans to launch brokerage services in Asia (2025) and expand crypto offerings in Europe, Robinhood is scaling up globally and positioning itself as a major player in multiple markets.\n\n___________________________________\n3. Long-Term Vision and Opportunities\n\n\u202210-Year Vision: Robinhood is gunning to become the #1 platform for active traders, dominate wallet share, and establish a global financial ecosystem. The endgame? Hold all customer assets and manage every transaction.\n\t\n\u2022$600B TAM (Total Addressable Market):\n\t\n\u2022$20B+ from active traders.\n\t\n\u2022$180B+ from wallet share expansion via products like Robinhood Gold.\n\t\n\u2022$400B+ from tokenization, staking, and institutional services.\n\t\n\u2022Untapped Opportunities: Robinhood plans to introduce new products like mutual funds, fixed income, trust accounts, and 529 accounts, adding even more revenue streams.\n\n___________________________________\n4. Exploring Sports Betting\n\nDuring the Q&amp;A, Robinhood leadership was asked about adding sports betting. They explained that while their Event Contracts fall under federal CFTC regulations, traditional sports betting is state-regulated. However, they\u2019re exploring the space, and here\u2019s why this could be huge:\n\t\n\u2022Gen Z: Around 20-25% of Gen Z already bets on sports, and this percentage is rising.\n\t\n\u2022Millennials: 30-40% of Millennials are active in sports betting.\nAdding sports betting could diversify Robinhood\u2019s offerings and attract younger users, tapping into a lucrative and growing market.\n\n___________________________________\nKey Growth Catalysts\n\n1.Crypto Leadership: Robinhood\u2019s low-cost staking and trading features, along with its plan to expand from 20 to 260 crypto assets, position it as a leader in the fast-growing crypto market.\n\t\n2.Diversified Revenue Streams: With nine product lines generating $100M+ annually, Robinhood is no longer dependent on just one revenue stream.\n\t\n3.Customer Value: Robinhood has delivered $34B+ in value to customers through lower fees, better yields, and innovative features.\n\n__________________________________\nWhy Robinhood Stands Out\n\n\u2022Low-Cost Leadership: Robinhood continues to offer industry-leading low fees across equities, options, and crypto, making it the go-to platform for cost-conscious traders.\n\t\n\u2022Technological Innovation: Tools like Robinhood Legend and AI-driven products keep the company ahead of its fintech peers.\n\t\n\u2022Expanding Global Reach: Expansion into Asia and Europe cements Robinhood\u2019s position as a global financial leader.\n\n\n___________________________________\nInvestment Thesis:\n\nRobinhood\u2019s combination of profitability, innovation, and expansion into untapped markets makes it a standout growth stock. With plans to enter institutional trading, expand crypto services (scaling from 20 to 260 tokens), and explore sports betting, the company is diversifying its revenue streams and positioning itself for sustained long-term success.\n\n___________________________________\nA Unique Path to Dominance:\n\nRobinhood stands to benefit significantly from the likely deregulatory policies of a Trump administration, which historically prioritizes free-market policies and reduces financial regulations. This could streamline approvals for new products like staking and tokenization while easing restrictions on crypto and trading practices. Additionally, deregulation might open the door for Robinhood to aggressively expand into areas like sports betting, enhancing its product pipeline and competitive edge.\n\n_______________________________\nConclusion: Robinhood isn\u2019t just a disruptor\u2014it\u2019s a company with the vision and roadmap to dominate the financial markets. For those looking for a high-growth fintech stock with global ambitions, $HOOD is a play worth watching.\n\nConsidering that most of us degenerates use Robinhood because we already know how beast this platform is, I\u2019m surprised I have not seen a lot of posts on it. With these numbers, this beast of a company deserves way more attention.\n\n_________________________________\nMy Position:\n\nCurrently, I\u2019ve got (1) HOOD $55 Call 1/15/27 because I\u2019m broke asf right now, but I plan to buy shares monthly until the expiration date of the contract. Considering how much potential this stock has, I might actually go ahead and execute the contract.\n[Investor Day Livestream &amp; Presentation](https://investors.robinhood.com/upcoming-events/events/event-details/2024/Robinhood-Investor-Day-2024-2024-Jy2w81uBO_/default.aspx)\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nEdit: I\u2019m adding this note because of a comment I received (and might get more of), just to be completely transparent. This post was formatted and revised by ChatGPT to improve readability, correct spelling and grammar, and keep me from going on unnecessary tangents. I\u2019m not doing this to be lazy\u2014I work full-time, go to school, and by the time 6 PM rolls around, my ADHD brain is pretty fried.\n\nI\u2019ve personally gone through Robinhood\u2019s 210-slide Investor Day presentation, read other takes on X, and reviewed articles from SeekingAlpha and Barron\u2019s in regards to the Investor Day news. I also caught the last 40 minutes of the livestream where they mentioned sports betting. The analysis and opinions here are mine\u2014ChatGPT was just used to make the post easier to read, and that\u2019s it.\n"

        "Content": "Ray Dalio has done an absolutely amazing job with Bridgewater Associates - kudos to him. However, I find that his viewpoints and his analyses, especially when it comes to China, are highly biased and, to an extent, nonsensical. Dalio has historically been a strong proponent of China, emphasizing its potential to surpass the US in economic dominance and advocating for the yuan taking the place of the USD as the next reserve currency. He held these views as recently as 3-5 years ago, but it feels like his stance has now moderated given what has happened in the last couple of years.\n\nDalio's earlier optimism about China's trajectory was grounded in its rapid economic growth, infrastructure development, and increasing global influence. Even at that time, several experts pointed out that he was underestimating structural issues such as China's aging population, mounting debt, and a slowing economy - something that he didnt seem to pay much heed to as he continued to toot the China horn. \n\nChina's demographic crisis, with its shrinking workforce and rapidly aging population, has significantly impacted its long-term growth prospects. Geopolitical tensions, regulatory crackdowns on industries, and a cooling real estate market have further dampened investor sentiment. Which Dalio can finally see - quite late for an \"expert\", I feel\n\nRecently, Dalio has changed his tune, almost ackowledging his mistake as he referred to China's situation as \"more challenging than Japan in 1990\". The arrogance he once had seems to have disappeared as he now emphasizes the need for caution and diversification, reflecting a shift from his earlier, unqualified enthusiasm to a more nuanced perspective\u200b."

I\u2019ve lived with family and saved essentially everything and have amassed $200k in a HYSA and another $150k invested in a taxable brokerage account, on top of my retirement funding. Capital gains in the taxable are only around $25k, as I recently started non retirement investing, so a lot of that is principle.\n\nRecently bought a $500k home with a 7% mortgage. I put $100k down to avoid PMI, taking my cash level down to $100k from $200k\n\nI\u2019m wondering if I should drop my cash reserves down to $25k as my emergency fund, and liquidate everything in my taxable and put $225,000 on my $400,000 mortgage, which will leave me with $175,000 left owed and $25,000 remaining outside of retirement. \n\nI can save $30-40k a year, so that means in order to pay off the mortgage, for the next 5 years I\u2019d have to put every additional dollar I have on the house on top of this liquidation and keeping my funds down at the bare bones $25k level.

I started like two weeks ago, buying and holding this share.\n\nThey now announced to built an ammunition plant in Lithuiania like two days ago and i could sell with 120 \u20ac plus on my 2.5k investment. \n\nSeems to easy. When do i sell?\n\nKind regards from Germany."

From what ive seen, there are various companies that offer different products:\n\n1. Arta Finance - minimum 10k investment, it seems that its like actually investing in a specific fund at KKR or similar, just at a lower price point and with more people\n2. Yieldstreet - seems to offer a mix portfolio of private investments oriented around growth or income, basically crafting a guided investment platform with privates\n3. Goldman Sachs / JPM / other banks- seem to offer evergreen private markets funds that work the same as a mutual fund with low minimums, but some minimums are still 50k+\n\nHas anyone used any of these? Any good low-minimum options for private investing outside of micro lending or crowdsource investment platforms?"

I can comfortably buy a share of VTI once per month, maybe SPY if I really commit.\nAlso I am thinking of moving my bank savings into a brokerage account where it at least gains 4.75 APY.  \nMy other thoughts are rolling the teacher retirement into a Roth, either one as I see my income going down to say less than current tax bracket it\u2019s on. \nJust wanted to get some thoughts, I know it\u2019s a lot.

I would consider Rivian to also be a long term stock, but it is more risky than the other two. My portfolio mainly consists of Tech stocks as for it is a market I am actively participating in and informed about, but I'm open to broadening markets. \n\nI was either planning on dumping more money into VTI, however as it reached $300 It became a bit too expensive for me to want to invest more in. Something I'm more concerned about is a crash, especially in the tech market as for it is reaching all time highs, but from what the tech market has shown in the past decade, is UP with some downs obviously. I know VOO and other vanguard ETF's are shown to do really well, but most of them are expensive, but in the end it may just be worth it. "
